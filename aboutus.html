                    <h2 class="text-center">ABOUT US</h2>
                    <p>Shipmates, this book, containing only four chapters- four yarns- is one of the smallest strands in the mighty cable of the Scriptures. 
                        Yet what depths of the soul Jonah’s deep sealine sound! what a pregnant lesson to us is this prophet! What a noble thing is that canticle in the fish’s belly! 
                        How billow-like and boisterously grand! We feel the floods surging over us, we sound with him to the kelpy bottom of the waters; sea-weed and all the slime of 
                        the sea is about us! But what is this lesson that the book of Jonah teaches? Shipmates, it is a two-stranded lesson; a lesson to us all as sinful men, 
                        and a lesson to me as a pilot of the living God. As sinful men, it is a lesson to us all, because it is a story of the sin, hard-heartedness, 
                        suddenly awakened fears, the swift punishment, repentance, prayers, and finally the deliverance and joy of Jonah. As with all sinners among men, 
                        the sin of this son of Amittai was in his wilful disobedience of the command of God- never mind now what that command was, 
                        or how conveyed- which he found a hard command. But all the things that God would have us do are hard for us to do- remember that- and hence, 
                        he oftener commands us than endeavors to persuade. And if we obey God, we must disobey ourselves; and it is in this disobeying ourselves, 
                        wherein the hardness of obeying God consists.</p>
                    <h3 class="text-center">SOME OTHER HEADING</h3>
                    <p>With this sin of disobedience in him, Jonah still further flouts at God, by seeking to flee from Him. He thinks that a ship made by men, 
                        will carry him into countries where God does not reign but only the Captains of this earth. He skulks about the wharves of Joppa, 
                        and seeks a ship that’s bound for Tarshish. There lurks, perhaps, a hitherto unheeded meaning here. By all accounts Tarshish could have been no other 
                        city than the modern Cadiz. That’s the opinion of learned men. And where is Cadiz, shipmates? Cadiz is in Spain; as far by water, from Joppa, 
                        as Jonah could possibly have sailed in those ancient days, when the Atlantic was an almost unknown sea. Because Joppa, the modern Jaffa, shipmates, 
                        is on the most easterly coast of the Mediterranean, the Syrian; and Tarshish or Cadiz more than two thousand miles to the westward from that, 
                        just outside the Straits of Gibraltar. See ye not then, shipmates, that Jonah sought to flee worldwide from God? Miserable man! Oh! most contemptible 
                        and worthy of all scorn; with slouched hat and guilty eye, skulking from his God; prowling among the shipping like a vile burglar hastening to cross the seas. 
                        So disordered, self-condemning in his look, that had there been policemen in those days, Jonah, on the mere suspicion of something wrong, 
                        had been arrested ere he touched a deck. How plainly he’s a fugitive! no baggage, not a hat-box, valise, or carpet-bag,- no friends accompany him to 
                        the wharf with their adieux. At last, after much dodging search, he finds the Tarshish ship receiving the last items of her cargo; and as he steps on board 
                        to see its Captain in the cabin, all the sailors for the moment desist from hoisting in the goods, to mark the stranger’s evil eye. Jonah sees this; 
                        but in vain he tries to look all ease and confidence; in vain essays his wretched smile. Strong intuitions of the man assure the mariners he 
                        can be no innocent.</p>  
                    <h3 class="text-center">ANOTHER HEADING</h3>    
                    <p> In their gamesome but still serious way, one whispers to the other- “Jack, he’s robbed a widow;” or, “Joe, do you mark him; 
                        he’s a bigamist;” or, “Harry lad, I guess he’s the adulterer that broke jail in old Gomorrah, or belike, one of the missing murderers from Sodom.” 
                        Another runs to read the bill that’s stuck against the spile upon the wharf to which the ship is moored, offering five hundred gold coins for the 
                        apprenhension of a parricide, and containing a description of his person. He reads, and looks from Jonah to the bill; while all his sympathetic 
                        shipmates now crowd round Jonah, prepared to lay their hands upon him. Frightened Jonah trembles. and summoning all his boldness to his face, 
                        only looks so much the more a coward. He will not confess himself suspected; but that itself is strong suspicion. So he makes the best of it; 
                        and when the sailors find him not to be the man that is advertised, they let him pass, and he descends into the cabin</p>
